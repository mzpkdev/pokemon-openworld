# Instructions
Install instructions for each supported operating system can be found in their respective directories under `docs/install/`.
Lines to those can be found under each heading.
This file only contains a short introduction to each supported system.
After completing the install instructions for your OS, proceed to
[Building Pokémon OpenWorld](#building-pokémon-openworld).

## Windows
**Windows needs one of the systems to build the project**

**A note of caution**: As Windows 7 and Windows 8 are officially unsupported by Microsoft, some maintainers are unwilling to maintain the Windows 7/8 instructions. Thus, these instructions may break in the future with fixes taking longer than fixes to the Windows 10/11 instructions.

On Windows, the project can be built using the following systems:
- WSL2, fastest
- WSL1, 7 times slower than WSL2
- Msys2, 20 times slower than WSL2
- Cygwin, 30 timer slower than WSL2

**NOTE**: Only WSL systems are recommended.

[WSL Install instructions](docs/install/windows/WSL.md)

[Msys2 Install instructions](docs/install/windows/MSYS2.md)

[Cygwin Install instructions](docs/install/windows/CYGWIN.md)

## Linux
The project can be built on any Linux distribution.
Distributions with instructions:
- [Ubuntu](docs/install/linux/UBUNTU.md)
- [Debian](docs/install/linux/DEBIAN.md)
- [Arch Linux](docs/install/linux/ARCH_LINUX.md)
- [NixOS](docs/install/linux/NIXOS.md)
- [Fedora](docs/install/linux/FEDORA.md)

Other distributions have to infer what to do from [general instructions](docs/install/linux/OTHERS.md).

## Mac
Some extra considerations exist to get the testing system working.

[Mac instructions](docs/install/mac/MAC_OS.md)

## ChromeOS
Only tested on x86_64 based systems.

# Building Pokémon OpenWorld
Follow these steps to build Pokémon OpenWorld.
1. Navigate to the directory you want to keep the project in, be aware of any system specific limitations.
2. Download Pokémon OpenWorld with `git`.

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/mzpkdev/pokemon-openworld.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the newly downloaded project.

    ```console
    cd pokemon-openworld
    ```
4. Build the project.

    ```console
    make
    ```
5. If everything worked correctly, something very similar to this should be seen.

    ```console
    arm-none-eabi-ld: warning: ../../pokemon-openworld.elf has a LOAD segment with RWX permissions
    Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
               EWRAM:      243354 B       256 KB     92.83%
               IWRAM:       30492 B        32 KB     93.05%
                 ROM:    26072244 B        32 MB     77.70%
    cd build/modern && arm-none-eabi-ld  -T ../../ld_script_modern.ld --print-memory-usage -o ../../pokemon-openworld.elf <objs> <libs> | cat
    tools/gbafix/gbafix pokemon-openworld.elf -t"POKEMON EMER" -cBPEE -m01 -r0 --silent
    arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary pokemon-openworld.elf pokemon-openworld.gba
    tools/gbafix/gbafix pokemon-openworld.gba -p --silent
    ```
    And the build ROM will be in the directory as `pokemon-openworld.gba`.

# Building guidance

## Parallel builds

See [the GNU docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Parallel.html) and [this Stack Exchange thread](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/208568) for more information.

To speed up building, first get the value of `nproc` by running the following command:
```console
nproc
```
Builds can then be sped up by running the following command:
```console
make -j<output of nproc>
```
Replace `<output of nproc>` with the number that the `nproc` command returned.

`nproc` is not available on macOS. The alternative is `sysctl -n hw.ncpu` ([relevant Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1715580)).

### Other toolchains

To build using a toolchain other than devkitARM, override the `TOOLCHAIN` environment variable with the path to your toolchain, which must contain the subdirectory `bin`.
```console
make TOOLCHAIN="/path/to/toolchain/here
```
The following is an example:
```console
make TOOLCHAIN="/usr/local/arm-none-eabi"
```
To compile the `modern` target with this toolchain, the subdirectories `lib`, `include`, and `arm-none-eabi` must also be present.

### Building with debug info

To build **pokemon-openworld.elf** with debug symbols and debug-compatible optimization under a modern toolchain:
```console
make debug
```

# Updating the inherited engine

Pokémon OpenWorld carries game-specific changes on top of RHH's
`pokeemerald-expansion`. Treat upstream updates as code integrations rather than
as a branch or release policy for this repository.

Add the upstream remote once, then fetch it when evaluating an update:

```console
git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion.git
git fetch RHH --tags
```

Choose an explicit upstream tag or commit, review its changes, and integrate it
on a dedicated work branch. Expect conflicts where OpenWorld has changed the same
engine code. After resolving them, rebuild every supported ROM target and run the
relevant checks before accepting the update. Record the integrated upstream
revision in the resulting commit or maintenance notes so later updates have a
reliable comparison point.
