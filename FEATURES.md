# Inherited engine capabilities

Pokémon OpenWorld is built on `pokeemerald-expansion`. The inventory below
describes capabilities inherited from that engine, not a promise that every
capability is enabled, configured, complete, or used by Pokémon OpenWorld.
Links to original feature branches are retained as source attribution.

## Pokémon OpenWorld product and residency

The repository builds one Emerald-engine product, `pokemon-openworld`, with
Hoenn, mainland Kanto, and Sevii in the same ROM. There are no FireRed,
LeafGreen, or per-region product variants.

Three-region **residency** means every registered map has its required header,
layout, tilesets, events, scripts, connections, section metadata, location
codecs, and callbacks, and passes structural initialization. Representative
maps are additionally **field-ready** when a normal full load reaches the
correct map, scripts settle, and player control returns. These are technical
content/readiness contracts, not gameplay scope: inter-region travel, Fly
routing, story progression, and complete Kanto or Sevii stories are excluded.

The local gates are:

```sh
make -j"$(nproc)" -O emerald syms
make -j"$(nproc)" -O DEBUG=1 \
  pokemon-openworld-debug.gba pokemon-openworld-debug.sym
make foundation-check
make e2e-foundation
```

The normal build emits only `pokemon-openworld.gba`, `.map`, and `.sym`; the
debug pair is the sole E2E emulator input. Foundation capacity and linked-
artifact results are written to `build/foundation/artifact-report.json`, while
Foundation E2E failures are recorded under `test-results/e2e/foundation/`.
